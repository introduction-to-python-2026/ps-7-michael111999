Dataset Used:
Wine dataset from sklearn.datasets

Selected Features:
- alcohol
- malic_acid
- color_intensity
- flavanoids

Observations:
The histograms show that alcohol and flavanoids have relatively smooth distributions,
while color_intensity is more skewed.

Correlation Analysis:
The scatter plot between alcohol and flavanoids shows a positive correlation.
As alcohol content increases, flavanoid levels tend to increase as well.
This relationship appears moderately strong and roughly linear, which is confirmed
by the regression line in the correlation plot.

Conclusion:
Alcohol content is positively associated with flavanoid concentration in the wine dataset.
This suggests that wines with higher alcohol levels may also have higher flavanoid content.
